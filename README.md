# Hunters  [ðŸ›  WORK-IN-PROGRESS ðŸ› ]
 Hunters is Unofficial Android client for [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)
 
 
 ## Android development
 
 Hunters is an app which attempts to use the latest cutting edge libraries and tools. As a summary:
 
 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * Uses [Kotlin Croutines ](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)
 * Uses Uses many of the [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/)
 * Uses [Jekpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
 * Uses [hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection
 
 ## Development setup
 
 First off, you require the Android Studio Arctic Fox Canary 6 to be able to build the app.
 
 ### Code style

 This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint), provided via the [ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/ktlint-gradle) gradle plugin.

 #### ktlint- gradle config

 1. Apply ktlint code style to Android Studio's code formatter
 ```
    ./gradlew ktlintApplyToIdea
 ```

 2.   Make check before commit
 ```
    ./gradlew addKtlintCheckGitPreCommitHook
 ```

 If you find that one of your pull reviews does not pass the CI server check due to a code style conflict, you can
 easily fix it by running: `./gradlew ktlintFormat`, or running Android Studio's code formatter.

 
 ### API keys
 
 You need to supply your product hunt developer token
 When you obtain the token, you can provide them to the app by putting the following in the
 `gradle.properties` file in your user home:
 
 ```
PROCUCT_HUNT_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=<your product hunt developer token>
 ```
 
 On Linux/Mac that file is typically found at `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
