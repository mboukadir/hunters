# Hunters  [ðŸ›  WORK-IN-PROGRESS ðŸ› ]
 Hunters is Unofficial Android client for Product Hunt
 
 
 ## Android development
 
 Hunters is an app which attempts to use the latest cutting edge libraries and tools. As a summary:
 
 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * Uses [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) 2
 * Uses all of the [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/): Room, LiveData and Lifecycle-components
 * Uses [dagger-android](https://google.github.io/dagger/android.html) for dependency injection
 
 ## Development setup
 
 First off, you require the latest Android Studio 3.0 (or newer) to be able to build the app.
 
 ### Code style
 
 This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint), provided via
 the [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) gradle plugin, and the bundled project IntelliJ codestyle.
 
 If you find that one of your pull reviews does not pass the CI server check due to a code style conflict, you can
 easily fix it by running: `./gradlew spotlessApply`, or running IntelliJ/Android Studio's code formatter.
 
 ### API keys
 
 You need to supply your product hunt developer token
 When you obtain the token, you can provide them to the app by putting the following in the
 `gradle.properties` file in your user home:
 
 ```
PROCUCT_HUNT_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=<your product hunt developer token>
 ```
 
 On Linux/Mac that file is typically found at `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
